# Cost-of-Living-Project
## Project Summary

Dashboard analyzing the ability to save money in various American cities. 

I've always had an interest in Economics, and I have heard that there are natural mechanisms in the economy that adjust cost of living for the salaries in a given city. 
As a result, I wanted to look into the data myself, and see if there are cities where people are able to save more of their income relative to average costs of living.
I found the following dataset on kaggle, which presented a unique opportunity to dig into the data: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mvieira101/global-cost-of-living 

**Skills Used:**
* SQL to clean and format the dataset
* Tableau for Visualization

**Desired Insights:**
* Which cities have the lowest costs of living, relative to incomes?
* Which cities have the highest costs for housing?
* Which cities lead the way in other categories (car payment, utilities, food, etc)?
